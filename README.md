# Custom Code
- Also as part of our project we must add three custom codes i choose a privacy, contact and Faq page. As my fail grade on the assessment said there was not enough custom code i have now added two extra custom logics. I have now added a new custom code feature blog which is an interactive blog post user can go to talk about everything retro kit related. This controlled by the admin so no bad posts can be added by a user . The user can comment and like posts.
